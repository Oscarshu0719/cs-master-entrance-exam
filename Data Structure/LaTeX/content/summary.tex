\item \begin{theorem}{()} \quad\quad \begin{itemize}
        \item AVL trees are ideal for sorting items of an \textbf{ordered dictionary}.
        \item Different number binary trees of height $h$: \begin{equation}
            H_n = \begin{cases}
                2H_{n - 1} \times \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{h - 2}H_i + H_{i - 1}^2 &, h \ge 2\\
                H_0 = 1, H_1 = 3 
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        \item $vector$ in C++ STL is similar to regular array that it supports direct access. \begin{itemize}
            \item Elements in $vector$ is stored in consecutive memory.
            \item If we make a sequence of $n$ insertions, there is a way that we can achieve $\Theta(n)$ amortizeed cost. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item (105NYCU-16) We can use \textbf{array} to implement \textbf{any} data structure, even user-defined structure.
        \item (110NTU-1) (\textbf{FALSE}) Quicksort where the leftmost or rightmost element is always chosen as pivot CAN the worst-case occur.
    \end{itemize}
